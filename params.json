The Contact constructor should accept the following String arguments: firstName, lastName, address, zipcode, and telephone number. All of these arguments should be accessible (i.e. contact.firstName should return the firstName string). In addition, the function should define the following functions:\r\n\r\ncall() indicates you are calling that contact. It updates an internal counter and returns true indicating that the call was successful.\r\n\r\nnumCalls() returns an integer indicating the number of times that contact has been called.\r\n\r\nContactList(). The ContactList() constructor accepts no arguments, but defines a number of functions.\r\n\r\naddContact() accepts a Contact instance and adds it to an internal data structure.\r\n\r\nnumContacts() returns the number of contacts in this ContactList().\r\n\r\nfindContact() is passed a String and returns all of the Contacts with that lastName.\r\n\r\ndeleteContact() is passed a firstName and lastName and deletes all matching Contacts.\r\n\r\nlistContacts() returns a string containing the contacts sorted by lastName.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
